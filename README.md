# Stock-price-prediction-suing-LSTM-network

Long Short-Term Memory networks, which are commonly known as "LSTMs," are a special kind of Recurrent Neural Networks that are capable enough of learning long-term dependencies.
In this code, LSTM model is used to Predict the Stock Price.
The code generates two visualizations:-
1- Actual stock price graph from 2010 to 2020
2- Actual vs predicted stock price graph
